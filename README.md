# libra4j

__UNDER CONSTRUCTION....__

libra4j is a Java client library for the Libra DLT. It is based on a generated Java version of the gRPC .proto files provided by the [Libra project](https://github.com/libra/libra). 

libra4j is built via Maven on Travis CI (see badge below) and tested through a large suite of JUnit tests, whose code coverage is computed by CodeCov: see dashboard linked by badge below. In addition, the code style and quality are measured by Codacy: see dashboard linked by badge below for details.

__NOTE:__ This project has currently been put "on backburner" in Q4 2019 and will be completed only when the Libra project gets close to effective launch (hopefully during 2020)
